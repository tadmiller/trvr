# TR//VR README

## What is this project?

Virtual Reality is a 21st century technology with numerous consumer, industrial, and scientific use cases, growing at an exponential rate each day. The crux of this project is to harness the undiscovered potential of virtual reality as a teaching tool for physical feats, and to teach a consumer tightrope walking. The brilliance of this project steams from the convenience it would provide to a customer, who may be too afraid or unequipped to create their own real life tight-roping experience with a physical rope to practice on. The application could be enticing for any individual, from olympic champion, to aspiring gymnast. As long as there is an interest and intent to learn this powerful skill, this project could transform dreams to reality.

This is the TightRope Virtual Reality Project (TRVR), developed as part of a computer science senior capstone project at the George Washington University by Tad Miller and Danny Nsouli. This project intends to break the boundaries of virtual reality by implementing real-world components. TRVR is a training simulator that teaches an individual with no former knowledge how to walk a tightrope. TRVR works by using a series of motion tracking sensors, pressure reading sensors, and a virtual reality headset. With these devices, TRVR creates a photorealistic immersive environment that allows the user to feel as if they are actually walking on a tightrope. By reading user data continuously and monitoring the user as they progress through three levels of varying difficulty, TRVR teaches the user and guides them to become a better tightroper. This is called the feedback loop and is one of the main components of this project.

## Why are we doing this?

### The short answer

Because we have to in order to graduate!

### The long answer

Danny and I wanted to do something in our project involving virtual reality.

When we initially petitioned Dr. Simha about this, we suggested a VR classroom application to allow students to learn from the convenience of their bedroom.

This was simply put: too simple.

So we ventured into trying to find something more complicated. The answer? Using VR as a real-world training simulator.

Initially, we thought we could do this with golf. But soon we decided to go with the tightrope project due to its real world psychological implications.

And thus, TR//VR was created.

## How do I use this project?

### Unity

Download and install Unity 2018.11f. Through Unity, go to Project -> Open Project -> select the folder "Unity/Tightrope VR". This will load the default park scene in Unity. You now have full access over this project. Use this wisely!

### Arduino

Download Arduino Studio. Through the package manager, download WiFi101 and ArduinoJSON. These two libraries will enable you to use both the serial version of our Arduino, as well as the wireless version

## How do I play this simulation?

Ensure your Arduino is connected to your computer, and your Oculus sensors/headset is plugged in. Run the included executable. Follow the instructions in the tutorial and you are set

We've included 4 different levels (title, nature, city, mountains) where you can use your Oculus and its sensors to walk across a tightrope

We suggest setting up the sensors about 6-8 ft from each other and walking between them for this

## What works, and what doesn't work?
Everything works!

At this point, you're only adding on to this project. Everything so far is functional

## How can I develop this project further? (Rising Seniors, read here!)

We thought about this a bit and made a list of ideas that could be done in the future:

* Arduino connection monitor - component of user interface

* Profile system (keeps records of stats)

* Physics mechanics with human model

* Options Button (for managing resolution and other smaller aspects)

* Pause Button

* Detailed control instructions

* Stage select screen

* End Screen/Credits
